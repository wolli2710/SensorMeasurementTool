SensorMeasurementTool
=====================

Get the current update Rate for one out of four possible delay rates for Sensors on Android phones.


As described in the Android docu: <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/SensorManager.html">SensorManager</a> there are four different delay Rates to controll the Sensors Update Rate. This Rate varies alot during different Smartphone models. For my masterthesis i needed a tool to check the Sensor Update Rate in Hz.
